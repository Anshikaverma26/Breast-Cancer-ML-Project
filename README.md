# Breast-Cancer-ML-Project
In this project we use logistic regression model to identify correlations between the following 9 independent variables and the class of the tumor (benign or malignant).

-Clump thickness

-Uniformity of cell size

-Uniformity of cell shape

-Marginal adhesion

-Single epithelial cell

-Bare Nuclei

-Bland chromatin

-Normal nucleoli

-Mitoses

Part 1: Data Preprocessing

-Importing the dataset

-Splitting the dataset into a training set and test set

Part 2: Training and Inference

-Training the logistic regression model on the training set

-Predicting the test set results

Part 3: Evaluating the Model

-Making the confusion matrix

-Computing the accuracy with k-Fold cross-validation
